# BSSPlus Platform Interaction Design

## Core Interactions

### 1. Post Management System
**Primary Interface**: Dashboard with post management capabilities
- **Add New Post**: Modal form with title, content, category, and attachment options
- **Edit Post**: Inline editing or modal with pre-populated fields
- **Delete Post**: Confirmation dialog before permanent deletion
- **View All Posts**: Table/list view with sorting and pagination
- **Search/Filter**: Real-time search with category and date filters

### 2. Chatbot Interface
**Location**: Dedicated chat widget or sidebar panel
- **Input Field**: Text area for manager queries
- **Response Area**: Formatted display of chatbot answers
- **Post Context**: Chatbot only accesses platform posts for information
- **Interaction Flow**: Manager asks questions → Chatbot searches posts → Returns relevant content

### 3. Post Content Display
**Format Support**:
- Text with formatting (bold, italic, lists)
- Clickable links
- File attachments (PDFs, images, documents)
- Timestamps and author information
- Category tags

### 4. Search and Filter System
**Search Bar**: Real-time search across post titles and content
**Filter Options**:
- By category (Announcements, Guidelines, Updates, etc.)
- By date range
- By author
- By content type (text, with attachments, with links)

## User Interaction Flow

### Manager Workflow:
1. **Login to Dashboard** → View all existing posts
2. **Create New Post** → Fill form → Submit → Post appears in dashboard
3. **Edit Existing Post** → Click edit → Modify content → Save changes
4. **Search Information** → Use search bar or ask chatbot
5. **Chatbot Query** → Type question → Receive post-based answers

### Chatbot Interaction Loop:
1. Manager types question in chat interface
2. Chatbot searches through all platform posts
3. Chatbot returns relevant post content or "No information found"
4. Manager can ask follow-up questions
5. All responses sourced only from platform posts

## Data Structure

### Post Object:
```
{
  id: unique_identifier,
  title: string,
  content: string (formatted),
  category: string,
  author: string,
  created_date: timestamp,
  modified_date: timestamp,
  attachments: array,
  links: array,
  status: published/draft
}
```

### Chatbot Session:
```
{
  session_id: unique_identifier,
  messages: array,
  context: post_search_only,
  timestamp: timestamp
}
```

## Security Considerations
- Chatbot API restricted to post content only
- No access to user management or sensitive data
- All interactions logged for audit trail
- Session management for manager authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
